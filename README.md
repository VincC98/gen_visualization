# Visualization Dashboard for Single-Cell RNA Transcriptomics Data - School Project

This project is aimed at developing a visualization dashboard to explore single-cell RNA transcriptomics data. The focus is on providing biologists with an intuitive interface to visualize gene expression in the brain cells of a rat.

## Project Overview

RNA transcriptomics allows the study of gene expression in individual cells, providing insights into intra-tissular heterogeneities. The dataset used in this project consists of 23,822 cells and 300 genes from the rat brain, divided into 133 distinct cell types.

### Key Features

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis:**
   - Initial dataset exploration to handle missing data and categorical values.
   - Basic metrics computation and summary of gene expression data.

2. **Visualization Features:**
   - The dashboard displays multiple views of the data using various chart types.
   - Users can filter data, select subsets of data, and observe how changes in one plot affect others.
   - Highlighting of gene correlations across different charts.

3. **Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction:**
   - Implemented clustering algorithms (K-Means, hierarchical clustering, density-based clustering) to group similar cells.
   - Dimensionality reduction techniques (linear and non-linear) help visualize data in reduced dimensions.
   - Interactive UI allows users to experiment with clustering parameters and visualize the results dynamically.

4. **User Interface:**
   - A user-friendly interface with customizable views, ensuring that biologists can interact with the data easily.
